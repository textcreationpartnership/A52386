            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is alÅ¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary to know the Å¿ituation of the Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> which lyeth in length about Å¿ix miles, having <hi>Hatfield-ChaÅ¿e,</hi> and divers other waÅ¿ts (parcel of the Å¿aid 60000. acres, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to other Mannors) on the <hi>WeÅ¿t,</hi> and the River of <hi>Trent</hi> adjoyning and running all along towards <hi>Humber</hi> on the <hi>EaÅ¿t;</hi> Å¿o as by conÅ¿equence (as well as by Proof in the depoÅ¿itions) it appears, that without cutting through the Mannor of <hi>Epworth, Hatfield-ChaÅ¿e,</hi> and the other waÅ¿ts ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>WeÅ¿t</hi> could not have been drained; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Participants did but at their firÅ¿t coming into thoÅ¿e

            <p>And although the Free-holders had Å¿uch a right in the Å¿aid grounds within the Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> as hereafter will appear, could not by Law be improved againÅ¿t by any Lord of the Mannor; yet upon the draining of the Å¿aid <hi>ChaÅ¿e,</hi> and the other Mannors lying on the WeÅ¿t of <hi>Epworth,</hi> the Participants by colour of the late Kings illegal Patent, did about twenty years Å¿ince, by force of Arms, murdering Å¿ome, and wounding and impriÅ¿oning others of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, violently enter upon their Å¿aid grounds, and have for divers years much abuÅ¿ed, and grievouÅ¿ly oppreÅ¿Å¿ed them, forcing from them the Å¿aid Lands, (being the Free-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ancient inheritance, and lying without the Å¿aid Level of <hi>Hatfield</hi>) granted to them about 300. years Å¿ince by a former Lord of the Mannor, in confirmation of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent right, which the Free-holders in thoÅ¿e times had, (for it is obÅ¿ervable, that the Deed makes mention, that at that time they had had right in thoÅ¿e grounds, time out of mind) and theÅ¿e Participants detained the Å¿ame Lands from them in the times of tyranny, by means of the Councel-Table and Star-Chamber, not Å¿uffering the Commoners to enjoy the benefit of the Law: yet Å¿ome of the Å¿aid Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pants by their Agents Å¿o much abuÅ¿ed the Commoners, that even in thoÅ¿e times Å¿ome of them were cenÅ¿ured in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> to Å¿tand in the Pillory, and by dureÅ¿s of impriÅ¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Å¿ore Fines, iÅ¿Å¿ues eÅ¿treated, threats and menaces againÅ¿t the Commons, and bribery (for they bribed the Sollicitor with 80. l.) Å¿ome few of the Inhabitants (the major part, and thoÅ¿e of the moÅ¿t conÅ¿iderable, being free) were forced to Å¿ubÅ¿cribe to Papers, the Contents whereof many of them never knew, as they anÅ¿wer upon their oaths in the Exchequer, but the Å¿ubÅ¿tance thereof indeed was, that they Å¿hould Å¿tand to the award of the Kings Attorney-General,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35334:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>whoÅ¿e award (without hearing the merits of the cauÅ¿e) was ratified and confirmed by the Decree of Court of the Exchequer, in the twelfth year of the late King, as by the Decree it Å¿elf, if Mr. <hi>Gibbon</hi> durÅ¿t but Å¿hew the inÅ¿ide of it, would appear; for further then the outÅ¿ide of it, it hath not be Å¿hewn to any Committee: and yet there is Å¿ome mention made of it in the late Councels Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, wherein Mr. <hi>Gibbon</hi> was certainly beholden to the Clerk that drew it; as if that Decree Å¿hould hold place, notwithÅ¿tanding the Participants own laÅ¿t Decree of the 10. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1650. and the Free-holders verdict at Law to the contrary. Now though Mr. <hi>Gibbon</hi> cannot abide to hear of the Title, and the proceedings that have of late been at Law in this buÅ¿ineÅ¿s (thinking to dam all up with the noyÅ¿e he hath made of a Riot) and though the Title hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been refuÅ¿ed to be heard or medled with by any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Parliament, yet the Free-holders rely upon that as their main Å¿trength, and do look upon your Honors as the only refuge they have under God to preÅ¿erve their rights ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, from the violation of thoÅ¿e, that againÅ¿t Law endeavour to uÅ¿urp a poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion: and having Å¿everal rights to the ground in queÅ¿tion, as not onely common appendant, but alÅ¿o common in groÅ¿s, (though the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be certainly included in the latter) they humbly lay down their Å¿everal Titles as followeth) and firÅ¿t as to common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant.</p>
            <p>The Free-holders and Commoners within the Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> have time out of mind, had common appendant to their Å¿everal Tenements, for all manner of Cattel, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and Couchant thereupon, at all times of the year, in and through all the waÅ¿ts and commons within the Å¿aid Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, (whereof the grounds in controverÅ¿ie are the greateÅ¿t part, and was alwayes of the beÅ¿t nature) and in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this their ancient right, Sir <hi>John Mowbray,</hi> Å¿omtime Lord of the Å¿aid IÅ¿le, having in his time made an approvement of part of the Å¿aid waÅ¿ts to himÅ¿elf, as Lord, did about 300. years Å¿ince grant unto the Free-holders by

            <p>The manner of keeping the Deed, hath been in a CheÅ¿t bound with iron, in the PariÅ¿h-Church of <hi>Haxey</hi> (the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t Town within the Mannor) by Å¿ome of the chief Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, who had the keeping of the keys: which CheÅ¿t Å¿tood under a window wherein was the Portraicture of <hi>Mowbray</hi> Å¿et, in ancient glaÅ¿s, holding in his hand a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which was commonly reputed to be an embleme of the Deed; till now of late that the glaÅ¿s was broken down: as appears alÅ¿o by the proofs in the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>It appears alÅ¿o by other ancient Deeds, before this Deed, that the Å¿aid <hi>Mowbray</hi> did make an approvement to himÅ¿elf of the Å¿aid WaÅ¿tes, before he made the Å¿aid Deed to the Freeholders.</p>
            <p>Now as to the proceedings that have been within theÅ¿e nine yeers in the ordinary Courts of JuÅ¿tice, the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders give your Honours this brief, but true account, as followeth.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Hilary</hi>-Term, 1645. they commenced Suits at Law, to try their right to the ground in queÅ¿tion.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term following, which was in the yeer 1646. (and not in 1642 as the Participants in their Petition to the late Parliament falÅ¿ly Å¿uggeÅ¿t) the Participants exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an EngliÅ¿h Bill in the Exchequer, pretending Equity, to Å¿tay thoÅ¿e Suits at Law, and to have the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the whole 7400 acres in controverÅ¿ie eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed with them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term, 1650 the CauÅ¿e came to full hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (till when, the Freeholders were not permitted a Tryal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35334:7"/>at Law:) and the Decree thereupon made, doth but eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion with the Participants as it was at the time of that Bill's exhibiting. Where pray note, that 4000 acres of the Å¿aid 7400 acres in controverÅ¿ie, had been then about five yeers before in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the Freeholders. And that Decree doth alÅ¿o give leave to them to go to a Tryal at Law.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, in <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term 1651. the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders in purÅ¿uance of that Decree by Å¿pecial Order of the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> proceeded to a tryal at the Bar of that Court, and had a Verdict, Judgment, and Execution for them, in the name of <hi>Thomas VavaÅ¿our,</hi> a Free-holder, and owner of an ancient Capital MeÅ¿Å¿uage and Land within the Mannour of <hi>Epworth,</hi> called <hi>Belwood,</hi> and a Gentleman of an ancient Family, Son of <hi>Henry VavaÅ¿our,</hi> Son of <hi>Thomas VavaÅ¿our</hi> the Grandfather, Son of <hi>Henry VavaÅ¿our</hi> the Great Grandfather, who married <hi>Joane,</hi> one of the Daughters of <hi>Robert-At-Hall,</hi> to whom by Partition, made between her and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> her SiÅ¿ters, the Å¿ame place called <hi>Belwood</hi> did come. <hi>Robert At-Hall</hi> was Son and Heir to <hi>Oliver At-Hall,</hi> who was Son and Heir of <hi>Margery,</hi> one of the Daughters and Coheirs of <hi>Thomas Beltoft,</hi> and <hi>Emot</hi> his Wife, to whom by partition with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her SiÅ¿ter, the Å¿aid place called <hi>Belwood</hi> came: <hi>Emot</hi> was Daughter and Heir to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard de Bellewood,</hi> who is one of the eleven Å¿pecially name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Å¿aid Deed of <hi>Mowbray,</hi> and lyeth intombed in the PariÅ¿h-Church of <hi>Belton,</hi> within the Mannour of <hi>Epworth,</hi> in a Tomb called <hi>Belwood-Tomb;</hi> Å¿o as it is clear, the Å¿aid <hi>Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as VavaÅ¿our,</hi> in whoÅ¿e name the Free-holders had their Verdict, hath both the Å¿ame eÅ¿tate that <hi>Richard de Bellewood</hi> now about 300. years Å¿ince had, derived to him by Deeds under Seal, and is alÅ¿o of blood unto him lineally deÅ¿cend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him.</p>
            <p>This was the firÅ¿t Tryal that the Freeholders could ever obtain in twenty years time, at which Tryal it did alÅ¿o appear by the teÅ¿timony of ancient WitneÅ¿Å¿es, that they had as well Common in GroÅ¿s, as Common Appendant, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35334:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>certainly makes the improvement by the late King Å¿till more illegal.</p>
            <p>And two things are obÅ¿ervable touching that Windmill mentioned in the Act of Oblivion, wherein the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are exempted from Mercy, as touching the pretended Riots committed in the IÅ¿le of <hi>Axholm:</hi> The f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>rÅ¿t is, that it was taken in Execution at the Suit of the Å¿aid <hi>VavaÅ¿our,</hi> for 80 <hi>l.</hi> coÅ¿t, and 12 <hi>d.</hi> dammages given unto him by the Jury, and the money paid. The Å¿econd is, That a Tenant to the Participants, who was owner thereof, did in his heat of blood preÅ¿ently after it was thrown down, bring his action of TreÅ¿paÅ¿s at Law againÅ¿t a Free-holder in the IÅ¿le for throwing down that Windmil, three HouÅ¿es, and one Barn, to which the Free-holder being Defendant, having plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Participants durÅ¿t neither let the Plaintiff (their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) try the cauÅ¿e himÅ¿elf, nor the Defendant try it, but pray upon Record to diÅ¿continue and let fall their own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to pay the Defendant coÅ¿ts, and 40 <hi>s.</hi> was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly paid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So as now, Right Honorable, the caÅ¿e in Å¿hort is this:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Land in controverÅ¿ie is 7400. acres of ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of 4000. acres have been now thirteen years in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion of the Free-holders, and is left unto them upon the full hearing of the cauÅ¿e, by the Participants own laÅ¿t De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in equity, of the 10. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1650. which Decree gives way to the Free-holders to go to a Tryal at Law; and in purÅ¿uance thereof, they have had a Verdict by Å¿pecial Order of the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> in the name of one that was no Rioter; and Å¿ince that Verdict, the Free-holders have been in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of all the 7400. acres (being their ancient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and they the true owners thereof) now three years this <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term 1654.</p>
            <p>It is therefore now humbly Å¿ubmitted, whether after the Å¿aid Decree in equity, and proceedings at Law, the miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of a few in a pretended Riot Å¿hall occaÅ¿ion a quiet poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the Lands in queÅ¿tion (of Å¿o long continuance,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35334:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Å¿o recovered) to be given from the Free-holders to the Participants, who never yet legally had it: Or that the Free-holders, who are willing to Å¿tand or fall by their title, either in Law or equity, Å¿hall not be admitted in a juÅ¿t and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table way to improve the Å¿aid grounds themÅ¿elves for the beÅ¿t advantage of the Commonwealth, having now teÅ¿tified their willingneÅ¿s thereunto, under the major part of their hands, Å¿ubÅ¿cribed to a Petition ready to be preÅ¿ented to your Honors for that purpoÅ¿e:</p>
            <p>And now, Right Honorable, Å¿ince Mr. <hi>Gibbon</hi> will not Å¿et forth his Title, or indeed dare not let it appear, be pleaÅ¿ed to take notice of what he tells all abroad, and that is, that they have the late Kings Patent, and that 370. of the people have conÅ¿ented to a Decree in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anÅ¿wer is Å¿oon given to them both: For as to the firÅ¿t, The late King could not by Law improve <hi>(cauÅ¿a patet)</hi> The Å¿econd is, firÅ¿t, as to the conÅ¿ents, there is not one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on that in a legal way conÅ¿ented: For by the Statute of 43. <hi>Eliz.</hi> it ought to be under their hands and Seals indented for the draining of Å¿uch Lands as are hurtfully Å¿urrounded, not Lands of 15 <hi>s.</hi> and 20 <hi>s.</hi> an acre: for therein is the cheat, that under pretence of draining a little mooriÅ¿h ground, they (the Projectors) ingroÅ¿s ten times more of the beÅ¿t ground from the people, and all muÅ¿t go under the notion of drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And beÅ¿ides, neer half of thoÅ¿e that are named in the Decree, never had right of common, and Å¿ome are named two, three, and four times over, to Å¿well up the number; but admit that they all had had right, yet they were all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and conÅ¿trained, and there are above 1100. Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Å¿o as there are more then twice as many that never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ented at all, and divers of the moÅ¿t conÅ¿iderable in eÅ¿tate. Indeed Mr. <hi>Gibbon</hi> hath been very buÅ¿ie to Å¿hew the outÅ¿ide of that Decree to every Committee; and it is true, the Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Seal annexed, are very fair to look upon, and Å¿trange things Mr. <hi>Gibbon</hi> labours to perÅ¿wade with the Å¿ight thereof: but to Å¿hew the inÅ¿ide thereof, how it is but the award of the Atrorney-General, that was in thoÅ¿e times

            <p>All thoÅ¿e twelve Heads (and many more) whereof Nine concern the equitable part of the Free-holders de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, hath Mr. <hi>Say</hi> not at all reported: which being compared with all that he hath Reported, will Å¿hew which way he Å¿et his byaÅ¿s. Now to Å¿et down his own words in the report <hi>verbatim,</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ting but in ten lines, which is all he affordeth the Free-holders, for almoÅ¿t thirty wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es, half a year here in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Inhabitants (Å¿aith he) in their defence Å¿ay, That the Lands before the draining fed Cattel fat for the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; but the WitneÅ¿Å¿es being croÅ¿s interrogated, Å¿ay, that it was overflown with water in Summer before the draining, and that in <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> and all the Summer long they took FiÅ¿h there in Å¿everal places, unleÅ¿s in a very dry Summer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They alÅ¿o Å¿ay, that <hi>Snow Sewer</hi> was pulled up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the IÅ¿le from the coming of Sir <hi>Ralph Hansby,</hi> then of the Kings Party.</p>

            </p>
            <p>ThoÅ¿e three Heads are all that Mr. <hi>Say</hi> hath reported. Now the Free-holders humbly beÅ¿eech your Honours to note but how he hath darkened and impriÅ¿oned the truth in all thoÅ¿e three Heads.</p>
            <p>As to the firÅ¿t, It plainly appeareth by thoÅ¿e nine Heads before mentioned, to be by him omitted in his report.</p>
            <p>And as to the Å¿econd and third, was it not plainly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35334:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>proved, that the inhabitants of the IÅ¿le roÅ¿e in Armes for the Parliament, raiÅ¿ed two Foot-Companies, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them at their own charge for them; and that what was done as to the <hi>Sewer</hi> and <hi>SaÅ¿s,</hi> was clearly for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Å¿ervice, and by command? And was it not offered to be proved by the Free-holders, (but denied by Mr. <hi>Say</hi>) that the Participants raiÅ¿ed upon this Level a Troop of HorÅ¿e for the late King, againÅ¿t the Parliament, and how they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded the life of the late-brave General, now Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi> being upon his return thorow that Level in his Å¿ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from <hi>Adderton</hi>-Moor, by taking up the Bridges, and preventing his paÅ¿Å¿age in thoÅ¿e parts?</p>
            <p>Now as touching matter of Riot, if it be put to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion between God and the ConÅ¿cience, who have been the grand Rioters in the IÅ¿le of <hi>Axholm,</hi> that is, Whether the Participants, that came in againÅ¿t Law, when divers of the Commoners were murdered and Å¿hot to death, and many wounded, who did but turn again (as worms trod upon will do) in the juÅ¿t defence of their undoubted Right of poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, which was wreÅ¿ted from them by Councel-Table, and Starchamber-Orders, their perÅ¿ons many of them impriÅ¿on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many enforced by PurÅ¿uivants and Serjeants at Arms to lie from their habitations in the fields under hedges, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their houÅ¿es broken to be apprehended, being uÅ¿ually termed <hi>Rebels,</hi> and threatned to be hanged at their doors; and plagued with multitudes of Starchamber-Proces, Å¿ome forced to flee out of the Kingdom at that time, having their goods illegally diÅ¿trained and Å¿old, for IÅ¿Å¿ues eÅ¿treated our of the then-Kings Bench; others, to Å¿ell and mortgage their Lands, to purchaÅ¿e an unjuÅ¿t peace, againÅ¿t the villanous, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, and forcible entries, &amp; intruÅ¿ions, arreÅ¿ts, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onments, brought upon them by the Å¿aid Participants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law. And their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion thus forced from them, was as unjuÅ¿tly detained for divers yeers. Whether there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now the Participants or the Inhabitants be the Rioters, who all along have deÅ¿ired Tryals at Law, but could not have them; nay, <hi>Gibbon</hi> himÅ¿elf Å¿everal times Å¿aying, (as is proved)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35334:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>they Å¿hould never have any Å¿o long as they were quick. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, let but Self-intereÅ¿t be laid aÅ¿ide, and ConÅ¿cience muÅ¿t needs conclude the Participants to be the Rioters, and the cauÅ¿e both of former and late diÅ¿turbances. And Mr. <hi>Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> and his firÅ¿t fellow-Participants in theÅ¿e parts, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever they were that had their hands in theÅ¿e horrid things, are well they have hitherto eÅ¿caped the Rope, for commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Å¿uch unparallel'd actions againÅ¿t the Law.</p>
            <p>All which notwithÅ¿tanding, be pleaÅ¿ed to Å¿ee the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of him, how under the notion of Riots he condemns the Parliaments Å¿ervice, and Å¿eeks to gain damages to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, even as for Riots, though things done for the Parliaments Å¿ervice. And his good old chapman and friend, Mr. <hi>Say,</hi> in the drawing up his Report, hath helped him all he can. To inÅ¿tance one particular: let his Report it Å¿elf, about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle thereof, Å¿hew his partial dealing, where he Å¿aith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion, That <hi>upon full hearing of the CauÅ¿e, the poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion was eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed with the Participants:</hi> whereas it is but eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed <hi>as it was at the time of the Bill.</hi> Wherein he tells the truth, but not the whole truth, as appears by the very Decree it Å¿elf, of <hi>Feb.</hi> 10. 1650. which alÅ¿o gives way to the Freeholders to go to Tryal at Law; and they according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had a Verdict, and both were returned in to Mr. <hi>Say</hi> as Chair-man; but he, in Å¿tead of Å¿ending them in to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, lets them lie in the Clerk's hands, and by deluÅ¿ion hath cauÅ¿ed others (honourable perÅ¿ons) to approve of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and to certifie their opinions againÅ¿t the Freeholders poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion, anÅ¿werable to the Participants deÅ¿igne, which is, to reach the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion in the grounds in queÅ¿tion, and fetch away the Å¿ame by your Honours extraordinary power, upon the Å¿core of a pretended Force committed by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to make null, or at leaÅ¿t drown all mention of the proceedings that have been at Law, and take away the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Free-holders Verdict, under pretence it was but a Verdict by default: whereas indeed, the Participants can never make any good Defence, and therefore Å¿eek holes and corners, and cover their naked Title with excuÅ¿es no better
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35334:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>then fig-leaves: For, was it not a Verdict at the Bar? nay, at the Exchequer-Bar too? and by Å¿pecial Order of that Court, after a tedious Suit in Equity upon the Participants own Bill fully heard? And were not their CounÅ¿el at Law all preÅ¿ent? But if this be not anÅ¿wer Å¿ufficient, it is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be tried again and again.</p>
            <p>Now what is it that theÅ¿e Participants would have? If it be but as they at firÅ¿t deÅ¿ired, to cut thorow the Free-holders grounds to drain <hi>Hatfield</hi>-ChaÅ¿e, the Freeholders are not againÅ¿t it; for they deÅ¿ire to do the Drainage no hurt, (nor ever did:) but to yeeld the Participants an Inch, and they to take an Ell, this the Freeholders deny: for they, under your Honours favour, will cut out their own Cloth themÅ¿elves, and improve the grounds both for the good of the Commonwealth and themÅ¿elves.</p>
            <p>And for any charge that the Participants have been at within the Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> although it might be anÅ¿wer Å¿ufficient, that they did it for their own ends; yet, upon a juÅ¿t Account, the Freeholders will allow them for every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, two-pence, out of the profits which the Participants have received and taken: and when that is done, they muÅ¿t needs be Å¿till great debters to the Free-holders. For as to the great charge that the Participants pretend they have been at in the whole Drainage, let them take it again upon the whole Drainage, where they laid it forth: for they prove no particular charge they have been at that way within <hi>Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> And as to Damages, what damages ought to be given to thoÅ¿e that have no Title, nor have made any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in the grounds? and if no Improvement, this turns the Å¿cale of recompence to be given to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, for all the time they were illegally outed of the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion. And if it be true, (as is affirmed) that the Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pants did raiÅ¿e a Troop of HorÅ¿e, and fought for the late King againÅ¿t the Parliament, and Å¿o were the original cauÅ¿e of the Sluce and SaÅ¿s taking up, mentioned in Mr. <hi>Say</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, whereby they pretend a great deal of damage done to them by the Inhabitants, who raiÅ¿ed two Foot-Companies
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35334:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>for the Parliament, and for their defence, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Å¿ervice, and by their authority, took up the Sluce, and drowned their own Corn as well as the Participants. And if it be alÅ¿o true, that the SaÅ¿s was taken up, upon a deÅ¿igne which Sir <hi>John Meldrum</hi> had againÅ¿t the late King's party; then certainly it is as clear, that the Participants and their tenants ought to have no damages allowed for thoÅ¿e things, till Mr. <hi>Gibbon,</hi> according to his Å¿aying, with his 300 men and horÅ¿e armed in aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the Scotch King, come to put the IÅ¿le of <hi>Axholm</hi> to fire and Å¿word.</p>
            <p>By this which hath been Å¿aid, it may appear, that the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Epworth</hi> differeth much in the Title from other dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which no doubt in Å¿ome places are lawful and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as being created by Law of Sewers, which this of <hi>Epworth</hi> never was; or by lawful and warrantable ways, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statures of Improvement; which this never was: for neither had the Lord a power to improve, neither was there any legal conÅ¿ent of any of the Free-holders to make it good.</p>
            <p>And now if Mr. <hi>Gibbon,</hi> according to his uÅ¿ual maner, cry out of Scandal or Riot, (for he is excellent at it) thereby to blemiÅ¿h or undermine the Truth, the Records that have been cited are extant, (if Mr. <hi>Say</hi> have yet returned them in) whereby it may appear whether theÅ¿e things be Å¿o.</p>
            <p>The nature alÅ¿o of the Grounds in controverÅ¿ie within this Mannor, differeth much from thoÅ¿e in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, moÅ¿t of it being a clay and Å¿and, and not Å¿o much Moory and MariÅ¿h as elÅ¿ewhere in other places.</p>
            <p>Now theÅ¿e things being Å¿o, the Free-holders pray and hope, that your Honours will not interpoÅ¿e with your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power, to remove a poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of their ancient Inheritance, or any part thereof, thus by Law recovered, continued, and Å¿etled, without due courÅ¿e of Law; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they Å¿hall humbly Å¿ubmit, and therein willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieÅ¿ce.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:35334:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The Lord direct your Honours to hold forth the Law to them; for there is nothing in this CaÅ¿e, that is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable at Law. So Å¿hall the hearts of many thouÅ¿and men, women, and children, in the IÅ¿le of <hi>Axholm,</hi> have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion to bleÅ¿s God for his deliverance, when they Å¿ee that through your means the Law of the Land is become their protection in their eÅ¿tates, againÅ¿t uÅ¿urpers and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers.</p>
